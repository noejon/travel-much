# traveller.js
I really want to know how much I traveled in 2019

1. Create an API key for the google API

2. Create a react app
3. Create the BFF in express

Use:
Docker.
Typescript.
React Hooks where possible and if needed.

steps: 
- just provide the cities in the order you visited them and the server will calculate the overall distance travelled (taking the shortest path)
- Define how you travelled from one city to the other how you travelled => calculate the distance in each travel mode.
- And overall
- export your travels as CSV
- print travels on a map

mkdir src
cd src
npm init
